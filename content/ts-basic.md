## TypeScript Basics

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It provides static type definitions, which help catch errors during development and provide better tooling for large-scale applications. In this post, we'll walk through the basics of TypeScript, from setting up to exploring some key features.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript offers several advantages over plain JavaScript:

- **Static Typing**: TypeScript enforces type definitions, helping to avoid runtime errors
- **Enhanced Tooling**: It improves the developer experience with better autocompletion and error-checking.
- **Large-Scale Applications**: Itâ€™s easier to maintain and refactor large codebases.
- **Community Support**: Widely adopted by the developer community, TypeScript has a rich ecosystem and support for many libraries.

## Setting Up TypeScript

To start using TypeScript, install it globally or locally in your project:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
